## ðŸŒ±  How to start this project.

This project comes with the necessary files to start working; you will need to clone its repository to start. You have two options for that:

a) Most 4Geeks students should open this project with Gitpod by simply clicking on the link: https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-postcard.git
	
+ If you do not have a Gitpod account yet, please register with your Github username at: https://www.gitpod.io/ 

+ You can start your Github account at:  https://github.com/
 
b) Only if the method above is not possible, and you need to work locally in an IDE on your computer you can clone the project by running the below command in the terminal of your IDE: 

```
$ git clone  https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-postcard.git
